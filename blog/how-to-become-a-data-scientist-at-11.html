      <h2>1.Introduction:</h2>
      <p>
        Becoming a data scientist at 11—or at any point during teenage—is not easy. Despite claims that data science can be learned without mathematics or formal foundations, this is largely misleading. Even in non-research roles, data science requires a solid understanding of the mathematical ideas that underlie the algorithms being implemented and trained. While industry positions often emphasize programming and model development over theory, mathematics remains essential for reasoning about model behavior, limitations, and failure modes. The depth of mathematical knowledge required depends strongly on the kind of data science one pursues, ranging from applied analytics to research-driven modeling. This article explores these distinctions, the learning path I followed, and the trade-offs involved in starting early. If you are interested in what it actually takes to grow into data science at a young age, read on.

      <h2>2.Differentiation:</h2>
      <p>
        First, machine learning engineering and data science are not the same. In ML engineering, the focus is on designing and maintaining systems for training, deploying, and running models in production. In data science, the emphasis is on developing models, training procedures, and extracting insight from data. Second, data analysis and data science are not the same either. While data analysis is widely used within data science, it is better understood as a sub-discipline focused on exploratory analysis, statistics, and interpretation of data. It is generally not concerned with designing or training machine learning models. Third, machine learning researchers and data scientists are also distinct roles. ML researchers tend to operate closer to mathematics and theory, developing new algorithms, model architectures, or advanced optimization methods. In industry, data scientists and ML engineers often work with existing models, adapting and optimizing them to fit specific applications and constraints. As mentioned on the About page, my work does not fall cleanly into a single category. I combine elements of research and applied data science, focusing on turning complex ideas into real-world systems. Exploring this hybrid role in detail would be too specific for a general audience, so in this article I will address both perspectives.

      <h2>3.Data science roadmap:</h2>
      <p>
        While I won’t discuss specific concepts with you here, for that I would need to write a book. I will provide you with a detailed roadmap which I partially did and that I perfected based on my regrets.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1. Concepts needed to be learned:</h3>

      <h4>3.1.1. Computer science</h4>
      <p>
        It is common to assume that data science requires only some mathematics and minimal programming. This is not true. In applied data science—unlike in pure research—the emphasis shifts toward programming, systems, and implementation rather than mathematics alone. As a result, a solid foundation in computer science is essential. At a minimum, this includes:
      </p>
      <p>
        Python and SQL<br>
        Core data types and data structures<br>
        Basic algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching)<br>
        Algorithmic thinking<br>
        More advanced data structures and algorithms<br>
        Fundamental software architecture patterns
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, many data scientists in industry do not have deep training in computer science, especially beyond the basic-to-intermediate level. This is not necessarily a criticism; most roles do not demand full CS depth on a daily basis. However, focusing narrowly on a single skill set is rarely a path to long-term success. A working understanding of adjacent fields significantly improves problem-solving ability and system-level reasoning. While much of this computer science knowledge may not be used explicitly in every project, it becomes crucial when systems scale, fail, or behave unexpectedly. At that point, intuition alone is insufficient. Once these concepts are learned, the next step is unavoidable: practice. Mastery comes from repeated application, not passive exposure. For Python specifically, I strongly recommend the freeCodeCamp Python certification. It is well-structured, covers both syntax and foundational computer science concepts, and emphasizes practical application. As a bonus, it is entirely free. For a broader computer science foundation, Harvard’s CS50 on edX is an excellent option. While the verified certificate costs close to 300 USD, the course content itself can be audited for free. If credentials matter for your résumé, the certificate may be worth the investment; if not, the knowledge alone is already valuable.
      </p>

      <h4>3.1.2. Mathematics:</h4>
      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, mathematics is essential for understanding machine learning. The core areas are:
      </p>
      <p>
        Linear algebra<br>
        Basic calculus<br>
        Probability<br>
        Statistics
      </p>
      <p>
        More advanced mathematics is not used explicitly in most day-to-day data science tasks or personal projects. However, a conceptual understanding becomes important if you want to go beyond surface-level usage—especially if you aim to combine applied work with research, as I do. From a theoretical perspective, much of machine learning can be framed in terms of probability and statistics; the remaining components concern optimization and implementation. To truly understand how algorithms behave, you must be prepared to encounter mathematical expressions and derivations from time to time. The amount of mathematics required varies significantly by domain and role. For example, some finance-related positions may rely more on established models with limited mathematical novelty, whereas large-scale advertising or recommender systems often involve more complex optimization and probabilistic modeling. Neural networks provide a clear example of where mathematics becomes unavoidable. Beyond the complexity of the models themselves, optimization methods such as gradient descent play a central role. While the basic form of gradient descent relies on gradients and partial derivatives, more advanced variants are commonly used in practice. Similar optimization techniques also appear when fine-tuning models, including classical supervised learning methods such as linear and logistic regression. For a general audience, this overview captures the essential role mathematics plays in data science. Deeper exploration depends largely on your goals and the type of work you intend to pursue.

      <h4>3.1.3. The rest:</h4>
      <p>
        The previous sections focused on skills directly tied to data science and machine learning. However, there are additional areas that are not strictly part of ML or data science, yet are still highly valuable. One example is understanding how computers work at a basic level. Knowledge of hardware, operating systems, and even elementary electronics becomes particularly relevant if you later work with robotics or embedded systems. Another important area is physics. While it may not appear directly connected to data science, physics develops strong intuition for systems, modeling, and abstraction. We interact with physical systems constantly, often without appreciating their underlying complexity. This section broadly covers general knowledge that strengthens reasoning skills across disciplines. You may not know in advance which of these skills you will need, but they often become unexpectedly useful, including in data science and machine learning.
